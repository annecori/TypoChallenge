<h3>Thank you for joining the Typo Challenge!</h3>

<p>
  Before starting, we are going to ask a few questions about you,
  to help us understand why typos are made.
</p>

<p>
  After the short survey, you will be given some instructions, then
  you will take the Typo Challenge itself.
</p>

<p>
  After you end the challenge, you will have an opportunity to 
  register your email address to stay informed about our study.
