  You are being invited to participate in a research study entitled the “Typo challenge”.  This study is being led by

<p>
  The purpose of this research study is to understand the errors made when entering dates in health records, so that such errors can be automatically identified and corrected in epidemic data.

<p>
Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time.  You are free to omit any question.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the study, the data from the Typo challenge will be analysed and summarised in a scientific publication, as well as made publically available with the publication.

We are not collecting any data that would allow identifying who you are, and we believe there are no known risks associated with this research study.
